# Pokeport

Pokeport is a Python script that queries [SpriteCollab](https://sprites.pmdcollab.org) and returns prints a portrait of a Pokémon to the terminal. It leverages [CLImage](https://github.com/pnappa/CLImage) to allow for unicode and truecolor output in terminals that support such.

## Requirements

This program requires `python3` and `pip`. Additional python library requirements should be installed automatically by the install script. 

Truecolor and unicode output requires a supported terminal. See [this](https://github.com/termstandard/colors) for more details, and a list of supported terminals.

## Installation

Clone or download the repository;

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deeshura/pokeport.git
```

Then cd into where you cloned the directory, and run the install script;

```bash
cd pokeport
sudo ./install.sh
```

The program should then be installed. You can check this by running;

```bash
pokeport
```

Which should print out the help page for the program.

## Uninstall

To uninstall the program, run the uninstall script.

```bash
cd pokeport
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

You can run the program from the command line to display the portrait of a Pokémon of your choice.
